When first run the application will take you to the home page which is the list of vehicles. 
There you can create, update, save and delete vehicles. 

The other two tabs shown at the top also have the same functionality but for Colours and Gearboxes. 
These were working but have unfortunately broken because I had initially set up the tables to be in different databases.
So I tried to put the tables in the same database but they failed to create new tables and couldn't find their original tables.
